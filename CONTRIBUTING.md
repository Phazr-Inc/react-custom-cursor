## Project Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ Cursor.tsx          # Main cursor component
â”œâ”€â”€ CursorProvider.tsx  # Context provider
â”œâ”€â”€ types.ts            # TypeScript definitions

playground/            # Development playground (if exists)
dist/                  # Built files
```

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:

- `feature/add-custom-variants`
- `fix/cursor-position-bug`
- `docs/update-readme`
- `refactor/improve-performance`

### Making Changes

1. **Create a new branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards

3. **Test your changes:**

   ```bash
   pnpm test
   pnpm build
   ```

4. **Commit your changes** using conventional commits

5. **Push to your fork:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Add tests for new features in the `__tests__` directory
- Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Ensure good test coverage for critical functionality
- Test both happy paths and edge cases

### Testing Guidelines

- Test behavior, not implementation details
- Write descriptive test names
- Use `screen.getByRole()` and semantic queries when possible
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

## Code Style

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Prettier** for code formatting
- **ESLint** for linting

### Running Code Quality Checks

```bash
# Check formatting
pnpm format:check

# Fix formatting
pnpm format

# Run linting
pnpm lint

# Fix linting issues
pnpm lint:fix
```

### Style Guidelines

- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer explicit return types for public APIs
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Keep components focused and single-responsibility

## Commit Messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for consistent commit messages:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
