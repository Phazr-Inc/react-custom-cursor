## Adding or Editing Documentation

- All documentation pages are in the `docs/app/` directory.
- For reusable UI, use the `docs/components/` directory (create it if it doesn't exist).
- Use accessible, user-friendly language and follow open source best practices.
- For code samples, use fenced code blocks and ensure they are copy-paste ready.
- Keep navigation and structure clear and consistent.

## Code Style

- Use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for formatting and linting.
- Use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) utility classes for styling.
- Prefer functional, composable React components.
- Ensure all colors and UI elements are accessible (high contrast, color-blind friendly).
